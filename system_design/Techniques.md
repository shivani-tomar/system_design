As I have told you that , system design depends on requirements and needs i.e. which which purpose it is going to develop and at what level it is going to use. 

Lets understand the context of my saying with an example. Suppose a you are designing a software for you collage library . In this case system security and risk is at small level as a collage may have about 10,000 students and books are also limited and of limited version. so memory risk is also at very small level. 

Now, imagine you are desinig a software for banks specially "RBI" then the security risk and saftety is so much important and you need to design a robust system applying a complex algo which make hackers to take time to crack it. And you also need to update this complex system time to time so that you can save data from prying eyes. Plus, you need a higher level abstraction as banks have most of sensative data and in case of RBI , it become so much sensative and crucial. May be you one mistake could lead to any disaster. These are the things which you keep secret even you are not supposed to tell you bestest friend as it is so much sensative information.

Now, I hope you understand what I mean to say.

But still , there are some basic techniques which applies everywhere while desigining a system and I am going to tell you these basic techniques with examples.

There are three levels of design :- 
1) Conceptual level
2) Logical level
3) Physical or implementation level

And there are some rules to design a system a every level.
